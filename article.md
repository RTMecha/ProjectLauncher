## Project Launcher News
Project Launcher now has a news tab! This shows most of whatever's going on with Project Arrhythmia recently.
This isn't exactly weekly, it's just whenever there's enough things to talk about.
IMPORTANT: These articles will NOT cover controversies / community drama. That's not what these are for.

## Alpha Branch Unity Update
Alpha branch was updated to the latest LTS 2021 version of the Unity engine.
This caused a few issues with a few things in the game due to undocumented changes with the engine.
Why Unity continues to not document things like this? Who knows.

## Alpha Branch Improvements
Despite the issues with Unity, the alpha branch is continuing to improve with a few optimizations and fixes!
Stuff like this is always exciting to see as it progresses.

## Better Legacy's first Prerelease
After a long wait, the next snapshot of the Better Legacy 1.7.0 update is here! But wait, it's not called "snapshot"?
That's right, this is the first prerelease for the 1.7.0 update, which means we are quickly approaching the full 1.7.0 release.
