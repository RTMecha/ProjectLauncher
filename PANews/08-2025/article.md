## BetterLegacy Snapshot Cycle Change
The snapshot cycle for BetterLegacy development is changing.  
Originally, a snapshot would release whenever a change is ready for release which meant a new snapshot would release almost daily.  
The cycle now has snapshots releasing each week, around Friday. This way, it gives the features & changes in a snapshot time to be tweaked before snapshot release.  
If you still want to test builds as soon as possible, test builds will still be posted to the #mod-testing channel in the System Error Discord server (only visible if you give yourself the mod tester role).

## Story Plans
What's next for the BetterLegacy Story Mode?  
Right now, a different series called "RhythmTech" is being worked on. The hope is to get something out from this series then continue with BetterLegacy Story Mode DOC.02.  
However, if you're worried there's nothing for DOC.02, there's at least 2 or 3 levels ready to go for the story. You might even be able to playtest them at some point, we'll have to wait and see.
