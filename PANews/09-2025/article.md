## BetterLegacy 1.8.0 Release
1.7.0 took nearly half a year to release, whereas 1.8.0 only took 2-3 months to finish. This update is called the "Expansion" update as it contains a ton of new features, and updates to pre-existing ones.  
This article discusses all the new features in 1.8.0.  

## Level Collections
Levels can now be placed into Level Collections. This allows you to play a specific order of levels. Good for stories or just for general playing of sets of levels.  

## New Prefab Features
Prefabs have been overhauled in this update. They can be recursive (prefabs contain prefabs) and can contain themes (good for character models that require specific themes). Prefab Objects now run on their own runtimes and can have modifiers.  
You can also share Prefabs on the BetterLegacy server.

## Editor QOL
It can be a bit easy to lose specific layers, but now with pinned editor layers you can remember what an editor layer is for by pinning it and giving it a name and description.  
Object keyframe editors can also be customized specifically for the axis modifiers. (e.g. changing a value to a toggle instead of an input field)

## Collaborating
Collaborating has been made easier by allowing other users to post to an item on the server. The Add Collaborator button can be right clicked to search a user to collaborate with.

## Asset Packs
The Assets folder in the mod has been completely re-organized to work with the new "Asset Pack" system. Asset Packs are functionally similar to Minecraft's Resource Packs.  
With Asset Packs, Example can be customized as well as certain textures, object templates / options and more. My aim is to eventually get these supported by the server and use-able in-game.

## Misc Features
Checkpoints now have a heal toggle (based on modern PA checkpoints), respawn (if players should respawn on checkpoint activated), reverse (if the checkpoint should reverse the song), etc.
The "triggers" from modern PA have been ported as Level Modifiers.

## What's Next?
Next up is 1.9.0, which is currently the Online Multiplayer update! My main hope is to overhaul how multiplayer gameplay works in BetterLegacy and have Arcade levels be playable with friends online.  
This comes with a few issues that'll need to be sorted, such as how local files are handled.
