## Mono Branch
Over on the Modern versions of Project Arrhythmia, a new branch was added called "mono".  
If you don't know, for years Project Arrhythmia was compiled using IL2cpp. This just meant modders trying to patch Project Arrhythmia's code weren't able to tell what they were patching.  
The Legacy branch was compiled using "Mono", which allowed modders to know exactly what the code did. This is one of the reasons why BetterLegacy was developped for the Legacy branch and not the modern versions.  
Does that mean BetterLegacy will be ported to the mono branch? Unfortunately, no. BetterLegacy is specifically built for the Legacy version of the game, and conceptually fits there as well.
