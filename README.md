## Installation and BetterLegacy setup
If you would rather install manually, follow the [BetterLegacy guide](https://github.com/RTMecha/BetterLegacy/blob/master/README.md#installation) instead. If not, then follow this one. (Install guide based on [Catalyst](https://github.com/Reimnop/Catalyst) guide)

	- ℹ️ _As BetterLegacy is obviously made for the **Legacy** branch, it will not work on any other._
	- ℹ️ _Go to your Steam library and right click Project Arrhythmia then click on Properties. Navigate to the Betas tab. Input oldlegacy2020 into the Private Betas field, click Check Code and then change the Beta Participation dropdown to the Legacy branch._
1. Open the Project Arrhythmia application folder.
	- ℹ️ _On your Steam library, right click on Project Arrhythmia and go to **Manage** > **Browse local files**_
1. Download ProjectLauncher.
	- ℹ️ _Make a new folder where you will extract ProjectLauncher.zip to._
1. Unzip the ProjectLauncher.zip file.

1. Select the Project Arrhythmia application to make a new instance from.
	- ℹ️ _Press the folder icon to open file selector, find the location of your Project Arrhythmia application and select it._
1. Create a new instance
	- ℹ️ _You can name it whatever you want, just don't include symbols that don't work with folder directories and don't include a + sign._
