Project Launcher is an application used to handle multiple instances of Project Arrhythmia.  

In order to use this, you must first own Project Arrhythmia on Steam.  
For now, the launcher only accepts the *Legacy* version of the game.  
To get access to this version:  
1. Go to your Steam library.
1. Right Click *Project Arrhythmia*.

1. Click Check Code.
1. Change *Beta Participation* to *legacy*.
1. Let the game update.

Now, you should have the Legacy branch. It is recommended to make a copy of the game elsewhere and switch your branch to the default / alpha branch.  
Once you've done that, you can now change the "App Path" in the Instances tab to where you just copied the game.

You can do this by clicking the *folder* icon next to the field.  
Now you can name the instance and create it by clicking the PA Heart icon next to the New Instance Name field.

Finally you can toggle what mods you want installed, change the BetterLegacy version, click install and click play once the install is done.
